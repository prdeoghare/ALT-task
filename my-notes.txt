Sampling ----
In the context of embedded systems, sampling refers to the process of capturing analog signals
 at regular intervals to convert them into digital form for processing, analysis, and storage. This process is essential in many applications,
 including sensor data acquisition, audio processing, and control systems.

 FFI----
